            <h1>"Food As Medicine" : term coined by Hippocrates 2500 years ago!!!!</h1>

                <div class="col-xl-7 col-lg-12 col-sm-12">
                    <p>Good nutrition and what you put into your body is the foundation for good health. “Food as Medicine” is a term which was originally coined by Hippocrates, the father of Western medicine; it was his belief that eating wholesome food is the basis for good health.  Hippocrates said almost 2500 years ago “Leave your drugs in the chemist's pot if you can heal the patient with food."</p>
            <p>Centuries ago the earliest known doctors and health practitioners across the world imparted the benefits of using food as medicine to heal the body and now based on research it is clearly evident that food plays a major role in health and how you feel on a day to day basis.</p>
                    <p>Hippocrates believed that illness stemmed from inadequate nutrition and bad eating habits and that if people were to learn good eating habits then optimum health would be restored.  Long before doctors and medicine was commonly used, wise tribal elders would seek out healing herbs and plants for their community and food would be applied prescriptively to bring about healing.  Slowly through the years man has moved away from the healing power of nature and towards prescribing packaged synthetic drugs and artificial remedies to deal with illness.</p>

            <p class="comparison intro-text">The reality is that because we have shifted away from natural remedies and we rely more upon chemicral drugs there is a very dangerours consequence that has shown up that is obesity.</p>

                Here above you can see two graphs one of them is that of propotion of overweight and other one is of increase in purchase of medicines over the years.
            </p>
            <p class="comparison intro-text">
                If you observe both the graphs carefully you will find that both the graphs are interrelated from which we can easily conclude that there is some relation between the increase in the usage of medicines and the increase in obesity.This is one of the many consequences which are being observed by scientists over the year that how depending too much on chemical drugs are making are life worsen.

                If food has the power to prevent much of the chronic illness we experience today then it makes sense to alter our diets to use it to our own advantage to not only heal and restore the body but also to prevent illness.  Although taking pharmaceutical drugs for ailments may be useful, they often come with short and long term side effects and contribute to the toxic build up in our bodies.  While drugs are important in life threatening situations, if long term conditions can be managed with diet and lifestyle changes then using food as medicine must be considered as a initial way of tackling the issue and preventing future health problems.

                    <p>You may want to consider a food elimination diet to find out which foods you may have a sensitivity or allergy too. For some people raw food although perceived as healthy, is way too hard on their inflamed and delicate digestive systems and they may need to begin by incorporating a liquid diet such as juicing and eating soups and easily digestible foods until their gut heals. Fish oil is a great way to naturally combat inflammation too.</p>
            <p>Numerous foods have specific healing properties such as garlic and onions which include antibiotic and antifungal properties.  Particular chronic conditions such as arthritis and celiac disease benefit from a specialized diet and avoiding particular foods. There are foods which reduce inflammation and ones that help lower cholesterol such as fish and omega 3 fatty acids. Doctors recommend eating at least two servings of fish a week. It’s always good to try and get the nutritional benefits from your food and not rely on synthetic supplements (unless you are on a specific diet such as veganism in which case you may need to include a vegan multivitamin.</p>
